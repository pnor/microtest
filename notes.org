#+title: Notes

Design


* general how-to-setup project
a testing *library*
so should build into a library, and then u import it and use it


* features
For each type of testing:
- graph based
- input domain
- logic
- syntax

Translating that into test types:
- normal *expectEquals* for input domain
- some kind of milestones for graph based, and check all paths traversed
- ? for logic
- ? for syntax
