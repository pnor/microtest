#+title: Notes

Design


* general how-to-setup project
a testing *library*
so should build into a library, and then u import it and use it


* features
For each type of testing:
- graph based
- input domain
- logic
- syntax

Translating that into test types:
- normal *expectEquals* for input domain
- some kind of milestones for graph based, and check all paths traversed
- ? for logic
- ? for syntax


* Input Domain
ExpectEquals to test the actual output

then to demonstrate, run many kinds of tests on simple functions based on different input domains
using the expect equals library

* Graph Based
Allow user to define milestones in the code (explicitly placed)

Then after running a suite of tests, and look to see if all the milestones where hit

In writeup can draw a similar lookig test map

* logic
???

* Syntax
???
